Currently building show working api and frontend
to do:

1. Daily maintenance volume
2. Maintenance rate
3. Starting fluid rate
4. Insulin infusion rate

Will then need to update docDef as req structure has changed (e.g. req.calculations.bolus.volume --> req.calculations.bolus.volume.val)

Before launch:

1. Test limits
2. Legacy
