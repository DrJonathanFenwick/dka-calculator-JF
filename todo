To fix from testing:

2. Add caps to form-override-confirm message for HHS and glucose boluses
3. API escape string rather than alphanumerics only (some factors contain slashes for example)
4. Fix no spinner while awaiting API response
5.

Todo:

1. Agree update to static version ICP to 1.4 - replace the fallback version hosted on site
2. Build /update page to accept retrospective data entry

Before launch:

1. Test limits
2. Legacy?
3. htaccess redirect for app level routes
4. remove from assets/api.js:
   //temp addition during API testing...
   console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
