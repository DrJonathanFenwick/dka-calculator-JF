Todo:
1. Change ICP update message to say unable to do update if no nhs number used. Also direct to button on start page rather than direct link.
2. Set update API response to make clear if no patient hash - cannot update as NHS number was not provided on original episode submission


1. Agree update to static version ICP to 1.4 - replace the fallback version hosted on site

Before launch:

1. Test limits
2. Legacy?
3. htaccess redirect for app level routes
4. remove from assets/api.js:
   //temp addition during API testing...
   console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
